          Which single option are we stress‑testing right now?

          BEST case (plausible, not fantasy): What happens? What leading indicators show up early?
          Examples: “demo lands an interview”, “user retention > 30% at week 2”.

        type: text
        prompt: >
          BASE case (most likely): What happens? Early signs? What’s the typical trajectory?

        type: text
        prompt: >
          WORST case (plausible downside): What happens? Early warning signs?
          What guardrails/kill criteria would you set?

          What piece of information would most quickly shift the probabilities between these branches?

    recommendation: "Multiverse mapped. Set probes/kill criteria and consider decision stacking."
