        prompt: >
          List low‑impact, fast decisions that unlock information (comma‑separated).
          Examples: cold emails, 1‑hour prototype, scrape base rates, 3 user calls.

        prompt: >
          For each low‑impact decision, what signal/metric will tell you it worked?
          Examples: “2 replies”, “latency < 400ms”, “N=3 user confirmations”.

          Which high‑impact decisions can safely wait until probes land?
          (funding ask, stack choice lock‑in, long contract)
    compute:
      pass_if: "max(year,month,day) <= 2"
    on_answer:

  end:

    recommendation: "Stack created. Run low‑impact probes first, then re‑evaluate."
