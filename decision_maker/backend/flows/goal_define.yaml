        criterion:
          rubric: |
            Sufficient iff the user’s statement includes:
            (a) a verifiable outcome (action + object) — not an activity,
            (b) a timeframe (date/range) OR explicitly says "unsure",
            (c) evidence of done (an observable proof).
            Accept multi-turn answers; normalize into one sentence.
        examples:
          - "Sign an AI Engineer job offer by Dec 1, 2025, proven by a signed offer letter."
          - "Ship a public demo by Sept 30, proven by a working URL accessible without auth."
          - "Run 5 km under 30:00 within 8 weeks, proven by a recorded time."
        bounds: |
          Only specify the goal (outcome + timeframe + evidence-of-done).
          Do NOT propose plans, steps, tactics, companies, or recommendations.
