          Rough split luck/skill for this outcome? (e.g., 60/40). Why that split?

          If you replayed this 10 times, whatâ€™s the distribution of outcomes?
          What repeatable actions push the distribution right?
    compute:
      pass_if: "max(year,month,day) <= 2"

    recommendation: "Luck/skill captured. Bake repeatables into your next stack."
